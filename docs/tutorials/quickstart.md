In this tutorial we will set up Dracon locally and run a pipeline to scan Golang repositories for vulnerabilities. Along the way we will encounter [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) and Dracon components.

## Requirements

You will need to have the following tools installed in your system:

1. [KiND](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
2. [kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/)
3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
4. [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## Installation

### Create a Kubernetes Cluster

Dracon requires a Kubernetes cluster to run in. We will use [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to create one. Just run:

```bash
./scripts/kind-with-registry.sh
```

### Deploy Dracon

Next, we need to deploy Dracon into our cluster. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
make dev-deploy DRACON_VERSION=v0.27.0
```

This will deploy various things to your cluster: Dracon itself, but also supporting tools, such as Elastic Search. Running this command might take a couple of minutes. It's the perfect time to go get a cup of coffee! ðŸ˜‰

### Deploy Dracon Components

Next, we need to install some components. Components are the basic building blocks of Dracon. They can be easily installed as follows:

```bash
helm upgrade \
  --install \
  --namespace dracon \
  --version 0.27.0 \
  dracon-oss-components \
  oci://ghcr.io/ocurity/dracon/charts/dracon-oss-components
```

And that's it! Dracon is now up and running on your cluster and you can start using it.

## Running a Pipeline

Now that Dracon is installed we can run a pipeline. Luckily, Dracon comes with a few example pipelines. Let's choose the Go pipeline: It takes a `.git` repository as an input, and then runs both [Go Nancy](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy) for SCA and [Gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec) for SAST on the repository. You can deploy the pipeline as follows:

```bash
make cmd/draconctl/bin
bin/cmd/draconctl pipelines deploy ./examples/pipelines/golang-project
```

This deploys the pipeline to Dracon. You can see that the pipeline was created
by taking a look at the Tekton dashboard. You can access the dashboard by running:

```bash
kubectl -n tekton-pipelines port-forward svc/tekton-dashboard 9097:9097
# Then open your browser at http://localhost:9097
```

You should see the pipeline in the dashboard:

Then you can run an instance of the pipeline as follows:

```bash
kubectl create \
  -n dracon \
  -f ./examples/pipelines/golang-project/pipelinerun.yaml
```

And that's it! You've just run your first pipeline with Dracon. ðŸŽ‰
To see the pipeline running, head to `PipelineRuns` in the Tekton dashboard. You can also [take a look at the Elastic Search dashboard that comes with Dracon to check out the vulnerabilities](/docs/how-tos/elasticsearch) that Dracon found.
