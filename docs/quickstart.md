This guide will help to quickly setup Dracon on a Kubernetes cluster and get a
pipeline running. The first step is to create a dev Kubernetes cluster in order
to deploy Tekton. We suggest you use KiND to provision a local test cluster
quickly. If you already have a K8s cluster then you can skip directly to the
[Deploying Dracon dependencies](#2-deploying-dracon-dependencies) section.

## Requirements

You will need to have the following tools installed in your system:

1. [KiND](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
2. [kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/)
3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
4. [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)


## Installation
### 1. Setting up a [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster

KinD is is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container
‚Äúnodes‚Äù. You can create a cluster with the following command:

```bash
./scripts/kind-with-registry.sh
```

### 2. Deploying Dracon Dependencies

Next, you will need to deploy a bunch of dependencies that Dracon can't work without. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
make dev-deploy DRACON_VERSION=v0.15.0
```

This will deploy various components to your cluster, such as the Elastic Operator and the Dracon Helm package. Depending on the capabilities of your workstation this will probably
take a couple of minutes. It's perfect time to go get a cup of coffee! üòâ

### 3. Deploy Dracon Components

Next, we need to install some components. Our components can be easily installed
as follows:

```bash
helm upgrade \
  --install \
  --namespace dracon \
  --version 0.15.0 \
  dracon-oss-components \
  oci://ghcr.io/ocurity/dracon/charts/dracon-oss-components
```

And that's it! Dracon is now up and running on your cluster and you can start using it.

# Running a Pipeline

That's what we're actually here for. Let's run a pipeline. We can do this by
using one of the example pipelines included in the repository.

Let's choose the Go pipeline as an example. You can deploy the pipeline as follows:

```bash
make cmd/draconctl/bin
bin/cmd/draconctl pipelines deploy ./examples/pipelines/python-project
```

This deploys the pipeline to Dracon. You can see that the pipeline was created
by taking a look at the Tekton dashboard. You can access the dashboard by running:

```bash
kubectl -n tekton-pipelines port-forward svc/tekton-dashboard 9097:9097
# Then open your browser at http://localhost:9097
```

You should see the pipeline in the dashboard:

Then you can run an instance of the pipeline as follows:

```bash
kubectl create \
  -n dracon \
  -f ./examples/pipelines/python-project/pipelinerun.yaml
```

And that's it! You've just run your first pipeline with Dracon. üéâ
To see the pipeline running, head to `PipelineRuns` in the Tekton dashboard.
